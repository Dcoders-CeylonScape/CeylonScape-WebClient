          The North Central Province is home to some of Sri Lanka's most
          significant ancient cities and archaeological sites. Anuradhapura, a
          UNESCO World Heritage Site, features well-preserved ruins of ancient
          temples, monasteries, and palaces, reflecting its historical grandeur.
          This city was once the capital of the island and remains a key
          pilgrimage site for Buddhists worldwide.

          Polonnaruwa, another World Heritage Site, offers a glimpse into the
          island's medieval history with its ancient temples, statues, and
          elaborate water systems. Mihintale, the site where Buddhism is said to
          have been introduced to Sri Lanka, features ancient ruins and stupas,
          making it a significant cultural and religious site.
